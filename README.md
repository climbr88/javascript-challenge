<h1 align="center'>Javascript Challenge</h1>

<h2>Scope</h2>

* Create a basic HTML page using JavaScript, HTML and CSS using provided dataset
* page should allow user to input date to return rows of data corresponding to the date chosen


During initial attempts, I used an input box to allow users to manually input a date, but since the dataset was limited to data for only 11 dates, I decided a drop down would work
be more efficient for the use
